            Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In JavaScript, the scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed in
                the code. There are three types of variable scope in JavaScript: <br> <br>

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Global scope:</strong> Variables declared outside of any function have
                global scope. They can be
                accessed from anywhere in the code. <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Function scope:</strong> Variables declared inside a function have function
                scope. They can only
                be accessed from within the function. <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Block scope:</strong> Variables declared within a block of code, such as an
                if statement or a
                for loop, have block scope. They can only be accessed from within the block. <br> <br>
                The keywords var, let, and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript. The scope of a variable
                declared with var is function scope, the scope of a variable declared with let is block scope, and the
                scope of a variable declared with const is also block scope.

        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong>The null and undefined values in JavaScript are used to represent the absence of
                a value.<br>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-7">
                <li class=""> Null is used to explicitly represent the absence of a value. For example, you can use null
                    to
                    represent a missing value in an object or an array. </li>
                <li>
                    Undefined is used to represent the absence of a value in a variable that has not been assigned a
                    value. For example, if you declare a variable without assigning it a value, the variable will have
                    the value undefined.</li>

            What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming
                Interface. It is an architectural style for designing APIs that uses HTTP requests to access and use
                data. REST APIs are based on the principles of REST, which is a set of constraints that define how an
                API should be designed. <br>

                The main constraints of REST are: <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Resource identification: </strong>Every resource in a REST API is identified
                by a unique URI. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Resource manipulation using HTTP methods: </strong> The four HTTP methods
                (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) are used to manipulate resources in a REST API. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Self-descriptive messages: </strong>The data returned by a REST API should be
                self-descriptive, so that the client can understand it without having to know the internal workings of <span class="pl-5">   the API.</span> <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Uniform interface:</strong> All resources in a REST API should be accessed
                using the same interface, regardless of their type or location. <br> <br>
                REST APIs are a popular choice for developing APIs because they are simple, scalable, and efficient.
                They are also widely supported by most programming languages and frameworks.</p>
